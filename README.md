This is a bot created for a studygroup's discord server for coordinating studying within the Study Together! discord server. The bot keeps track of one person to ping when someone would like to join the group on the Study Together! server, and the channel number in the server. 

Once the client token and channel id are substituted in bot.py, simply write .studybothelp in chat for a help prompt.
